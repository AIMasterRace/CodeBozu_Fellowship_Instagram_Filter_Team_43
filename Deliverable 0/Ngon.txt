For most people, I think, the ethics of image manipulation is never on their mind because it is something we do without a second thought. This is largely justified since many of the photos we took and saw on the internet are considered a form of art and not for documentary purposes. As such, any manipulation is a fair game as these images express the photographer's ideal .But for the few that are used for documentation, image manipulation can be a gray area. These images are meant to portray nature and events as accurately as possible, so in my opinion as long as the manipulation in some way or another enhances/makes the image truer to reality then anything goes. This is easier said than done because the “truth” is quite ambiguous, any events and scenery can have many different ‘angles' and as a result any photo trying to capture that “truth" is fundamentally flawed. So after all that has been said, the ethics of image manipulation can only be  judged on the photographer's intention, as long as the photo doesn't try to mislead/deceive the viewer then there is nothing morally wrong with the manipulation.
