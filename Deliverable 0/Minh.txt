To what extent can an image be manipulated ethically? It's as if we can't trust anything we see nowadays—what with technology being so readily available to show all but the original image. In fact, can we even trust the "original" image? Cameras are flawed, in the sense that any interpretation of reality will ultimately be subject to the technical specifications of each camera. But, more importantly, when can someone modify an image? Certainly, the purpose of such manipulation is important: it's okay to edit an image for aesthetic purposes, but it's wrong to try and deceive the viewer. Yet, people sometimes tend to want to be deceived—they want entertainment. So much so that people expect to be deceived when they go to such functions as a magic show. But they hate it when they are lied to in places where they expect only the truth, like in the news. The ethicality of image manipulation is a complicated proposition. But just know that the right view on this subject is where our heart lies: we would not lie to loved one, so why would it be any different if we lied through images?
